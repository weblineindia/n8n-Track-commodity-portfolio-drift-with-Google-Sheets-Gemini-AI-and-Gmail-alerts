# Commodity Portfolio Tracker using n8n, Google Sheets, Gemini AI & Gmail Alerts

This workflow automatically monitors a commodity portfolio stored in Google Sheets, compares actual allocation against predefined targets, detects deviations and sends intelligent rebalance alerts via email using Gemini AI. It also logs every run (success, failure or no action) into a tracking sheet for audit purposes.

### Quick Implementation Steps

1. Connect Google Sheets, Gmail and Gemini credentials in your n8n account.
2. Add holdings data in Google Sheets.
3. Configure targets in **Workflow Settings** node.
4. Create `rebalance_log` sheet with required columns.
5. Test workflow → Activate schedule.

## What It Does

This workflow acts as an automated portfolio monitoring system specifically designed for commodity-based investments such as Gold, Silver, Oil, Copper and Natural Gas. It reads portfolio holdings using the **Read Holdings** node and combines them with configuration from the **Workflow Settings** node.

The workflow validates data through **Validate Portfolio Data**, calculates allocation via **Calculate Portfolio Allocation** and identifies deviations using **Detect Portfolio Drift**. If deviations exceed limits, **Classify Alert Severity** determines how critical the situation is.

Finally, **Build Alert Prompt** and **Generate Alert Message** (Gemini AI) create a human-readable alert, which is processed in **Prepare Alert Payload**, sent via **Send Rebalance Email** and logged using **Log Sent Alert**, **Log Validation Failure** or **Log No Action** depending on the outcome.

## Who It's For

- Financial advisors managing client portfolios
- Individual investors tracking commodity allocations
- Portfolio managers looking for automation
- FinTech developers building advisory tools
- Anyone who wants rule-based rebalancing alerts

## Requirements

- [**n8n account** (Self-hosted or Cloud)](https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/om1efg2qgvwi)
- Google Sheets account (for holdings + logs)
- Gmail account (for sending alerts)
- Google Gemini API credentials
- Basic understanding of n8n nodes and workflows

## How It Works & Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare Google Sheets

Create two sheets:

#### Holdings Sheet

Columns example:

`asset, units, price, current_value, last_updated`

#### Log Sheet (`rebalance_log`)

Columns:

`run_date,total_value,rebalance_needed,severity,affected_assets,alert_sent,summary,reason_skipped`

### Step 2: Configure Workflow Settings Node

Update values inside **Workflow Settings** node:

- Target allocation (must sum to 100)
- Min/Max ranges
- Alert email
- Severity thresholds
- Currency

### Step 3: Connect Credentials

- Google Sheets → used in **Read Holdings**, **Log Sent Alert**, **Log Validation Failure**, **Log No Action**
- Gmail → used in **Send Rebalance Email**
- Gemini → used in **Generate Alert Message**

### Step 4: Workflow Execution Flow (Node-by-Node)

1. **Schedule Trigger** starts the workflow.
2. **Read Holdings** fetches portfolio data.
3. **Workflow Settings** provides configuration.
4. **Synchronize Inputs** merges both sources.
5. **Prepare Portfolio Context** structures the data.
6. **Validate Portfolio Data** ensures correctness.
7. **Check Validation Status** routes valid/invalid data.
8. **Calculate Portfolio Allocation** computes percentages.
9. **Detect Portfolio Drift** identifies deviations.
10. **Check Rebalance Requirement** decides action path.
11. **Classify Alert Severity** assigns severity level.
12. **Build Alert Prompt** prepares AI input.
13. **Generate Alert Message** creates final message.
14. **Merge Alert Data** combines AI + data.
15. **Prepare Alert Payload** formats output.
16. **Send Rebalance Email** sends alert.
17. **Log Sent Alert / Log No Action / Log Validation Failure** store results.

## How To Customize Nodes

- **Workflow Settings**: Change targets, thresholds, email.
- **Schedule Trigger**: Modify frequency (hourly/daily/weekly).
- **Gemini Node**: Adjust tone of alert messages.
- **Email Node**: Add CC/BCC or change format.
- **Code Nodes**: Customize calculation logic (e.g., percentage vs amount-based rebalancing).

## Add-ons

- Slack integration for high severity alerts
- Dashboard visualization using Google Data Studio
- Multi-client portfolio support
- Real-time price API integration (NSE, Alpha Vantage, etc.)
- Risk scoring system for portfolios

## Use Case Examples

1. Daily monitoring of commodity portfolios.
2. Automated advisory alerts for wealth managers.
3. DIY investor portfolio tracking system.
4. Risk management for diversified assets.
5. Audit trail for compliance and reporting.

There can be many more variations of this workflow depending on business needs.

## Troubleshooting Guide

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| No columns found | Sheet missing headers | Add header row in first row |
| Undefined values in log | Wrong node connection | Connect from payload node instead of email node |
| Email not sent | Gmail credentials issue | Reconnect Gmail account |
| AI output empty | Prompt or API issue | Check Gemini node input |
| Validation failed | Incorrect data format | Fix holdings sheet values |
